# React Dashboard Boilerplate
### This dashboard is meant to be used for discord bots, but you can use it for other things
### I ask that you have a decent understanding of react because I will not help you with setting this up.

# How to Install:
- `npm i` To install packages needed
- `npm run build` - To create the React build folder
- Set up your `.env` file
- Find the API File in `src/util` and put in your bots ID
also in that file you should see something labeled as `scope` replace the current ones with what you need
